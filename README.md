# bottom-hs

## wtf is this

it's an implementation of the bottom encoding protocol in haskell
https://github.com/bottom-software-foundation/spec

## y tho

because i can

## you should add...

i'ma stop you right there bud, this was for a laugh.

what's that phrase that means "GFY" in open source? oh, yeah!

"PRs welcome"

## how do i use it?

honestly, i'm a haskell n00blet, but

 - clone the repo
 - `stack build`
 - pipe some data into `bottom`

it also has a -d flag for decoding.

this repo technically exports a library? but i'm still figuring out
how that should work. tbqh, this whole thing was just so i would
figure out some of the less glamourous parts of writing command line
tools in haskell, like, how to interact with the terminal or how to
reference a module, rather than just messing around at the repl forever
